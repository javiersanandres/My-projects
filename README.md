# My-projects

In this subject, we worked with SQL and databases. Our first project consists on making some queries in order to obtain certain information about an specific database. On our second project, we familiarized with ODBC, by making some Data Structures which were able to process any querie on our private database. Finally, on our third project, we focused more in the part of storing a database information.
