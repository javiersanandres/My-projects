# My-projects

In this subject, we had to create some environment that could test the efficiency of some algoritms. Depending on the practice (1, 2 or 3), we measure different algorithms. In the first case, we analyze quadratic sorting methods; in the second case, we focus a little bit more on recursive ones (QuickSort and MergeSort) and in the third case, searching methods in a dictionary.
