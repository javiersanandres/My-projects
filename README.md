# My-projects

This subject consisted of three intermidiate practices wich lead to the creation of a final project. This final project, which is the only one I am showing in this repository, is an approach to a mining-network like Bitcoin. I used semaphores, shared memory and other tools related to how the computer works internally (OS) to develop this project.
